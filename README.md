# MERN Book Search Engine - Module 21

## About This Project

#### The book search engine allows you to search for books using a built in google books API that has access to a vast library of books including author information, title, pages, etc. You can create an account and login (all of your information is encrypted and authorized using bcrypt and jwt) afterwards you can save books to your account. Your saved books acts as a 'read later' library.

## How it works:

#### The program initializes with a front end UI which presents you with a search bar that will populate the page with a gallery of books their titles authors and other information. You as a user can login and save your books to a saved book list. You may also remove saved books.
